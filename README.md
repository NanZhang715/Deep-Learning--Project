# Deep-Learning--Project

## Mission: ## 
Built a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed. Furtheremore, This Project is built with Convolutional Neural Networks throughout the process. 

## Deep Neural Network Class: ##
CNN(Convolutional Neural Network)

## Instructions ## 

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.
```git clone https://github.com/udacity/dog-project.git
cd dog-project
```

Download the dog dataset [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip). Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location path/to/dog-project/dogImages.

Download the human dataset [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/lfw.zip). Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location path/to/dog-project/lfw. If you are using a Windows machine, you are encouraged to use 7zip to extract the folder.

Download the VGG-16 bottleneck features [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogVGG16Data.npz) for the dog dataset. Place it in the repo, at location path/to/dog-project/bottleneck_features.
