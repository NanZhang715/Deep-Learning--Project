# Deep-Learning--Project
Built a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed. Furtheremore, This Project is built with Convolutional Neural Networks throughout the process.
